                Exactly 1010 days since I got the courage to ask for this photo. My balls had to double in size that day 😌. Even more so though one month later when I *tried* telling you how much I liked you hehe. That was such a gamble. My brain still couldn't wrap my mind around if it was possible that you liked me too. But I'm so grateful you did.<br><br>

                Out of the list of 21 "reasons" I love you pookie, I'm starting with the fact that you saw me for who I am and liked me anyway. You saw something worth loving and have been filling me with your love ever since. You made me feel so special and worthy of love when I had never felt that before. You. Chose. Me. And now you're stuck with it no take backsies hehe :).<br><br>

                If you weren't so loving pookie, I wouldn't be the happiest boyfriend+ (between bf and fiance hehe) ever right now. Even now it's still so mind boggling how someone so cool, funny, pretty, and amazing could see me that way. <br><br>
                
                And ever since then, you've only given me more and more love, even when I feel like I don't deserve it. You're always there for me and treating me, and gifting me, and loving me in all of your different ways. From comforting me, driving me around, feeding me :))) and taking care of me when I get sick. <br><br>

                So as we start our new year boo boo, I'm so grateful to you for being the most loving, caring, and kind person I could ever dream of (even when you're a bit of a meanie beanie). Anyway, here's my official confirmation statement of a renewed love premium subscription from you hehe. I can't wait to spend this next year with your love. I'll never grow tired of it. Love you so much boo boo.

                <br><br><br>

                Love, <br>
                Ooo Ooo ♡
